#PlayNow

Small app to create empty Swift playground files and open them with Xcode.

## Installation

Best way is to install using curl so it bypasses Gatekeeper (Thanks [mxcl](https://twitter.com/mxcl) for the [tip](https://coderwall.com/p/ki0jxw?i=2&p=1&q=author%3Amxcl&t[]=mxcl)!):

    cd /Applications && curl -L https://github.com/apalancat/PlayNow/releases/download/v0.1/PlayNow.tgz | tar x

## How to use it?

1. Open the app with your favorite App Launcher (or manually)
2. It creates a new Playground in /tmp
3. The Playground opens automatically in Xcode
4. ??
5. Profit
